/***************************************************************************************
 * 
 * Implement a magic directory with buildDict, and search methods.
 * 
 * For the method buildDict, you'll be given a list of non-repetitive words to build a
 * dictionary.
 * 
 * For the method search, you'll be given a word, and judge whether if you modify
 * exactly one character into another character in this word, the modified word is in
 * the dictionary you just built.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: buildDict(["hello", "leetcode"]), Output: Null
 * Input: search("hello"), Output: False
 * Input: search("hhllo"), Output: True
 * Input: search("hell"), Output: False
 * Input: search("leetcoded"), Output: False
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * You may assume that all the inputs are consist of lowercase letters a-z.
 * For contest purpose, the test data is rather small by now. You could think about
 * highly efficient algorithm after the contest.
 * Please remember to RESET your class variables declared in class MagicDictionary, as
 * static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see here for
 * more details.
 *
