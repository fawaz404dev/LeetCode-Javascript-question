/***************************************************************************************
 *
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day
 * i.
 *
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many
 * transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times)
 * . However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you
 * must sell the stock before you buy again).
